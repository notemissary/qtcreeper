# qtcreeper

This one is going to a port for Python 3. But it's not ready yet!

**Requires**
* Python 3, https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/
* requests module
* ujson - the fastes json lodader which is used like two times in the code, lol

**Windows installation instructions for noobs**
* Install Python 3.6+ (*not* version 2), https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe (link to 32 bit
version but will probably work on all systems)
* In the qtcreeper github, click "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP" to download all necessary files
* Extract ZIP file
* Open cmd and do `pip install requests ujson`
* Double click qtcreeper.py to run

**Misc notes**
* On running qtcreeper you will be prompted to specify your username/password and the type of qts to search for, this
will be saved across launches
* Settings data (config and list of already visited qts) is stored in a `data` folder in the program directory
