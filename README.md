# qtcreeper

This one is going to a port for Python 3. But it's not ready yet!

**Requires**
* Python 3, https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/
* python-requests module, which is included for convenience, but deleting it and installing it via Python's pip install tool might be better if you know how

**Windows installation instructions for noobs**
* Install Python 3.6 (*not* version 2), https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe (link to 32 bit version but will probably work on all systems)
* In the qtcreeper github, click "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP" to download all necessary files
* Extract ZIP file
* Double click qtcreeper.py to run

**Misc notes**
* On running qtcreeper you will be prompted to specify your username/password and the type of qts to search for, this will be saved across launches
* Settings data (config and list of already visited qts) is stored in a .qtcreeper folder in your home directory (something like C:/Users/Username/.qtcreeper/ on windows)
